# NorKEY-Mac

Forked from EurKey for Mac.

The only reason this exists, is that I wanted a US layout ish setup for special keys like [], {} ... that are horrific to type on the Norwegian ISO layout.

Changes 2 things from default EurKey

- æøå is moved to its usual location, hidden under the option (Altgr) modifier.
- moved braces and and symbol to its regular locations

When saying usual and regular locations here this means how its mapped on the Norwegian keyboard layout.

This is shoddy work, and there are duplicate keys.

# Install

Copy `NorKEY.keylayout` to your library, either system-wide (`/Library/Keyboard Layouts`) or for your local user (`~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`). A system-wide installation is preferred though to ensure the layout is available to all applications. (See also [this Superuser answer](https://superuser.com/a/561613/263461).)
